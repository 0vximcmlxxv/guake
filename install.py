# Beware:
#  - this script is executed using the system's python, so with not easy control on which
#    packages are available. Same, we cannot directly install new ones using pip.
#  - the role of the first stage of this installer is just to install a fresh new virtualenv
#    with a *controled* version of python, pip and virtualenv, and launch the second part of
#    the installer, 'install-stage2.py', which will run in the virtualenv.

# Note:
#  - I try to keep this installer python-2.6 friendly, but I really encourage you to install
#    Python 2.7
