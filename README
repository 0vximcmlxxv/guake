Guake README file
=================

INTRO
~~~~~

Guake is a dropdown terminal made for the GNOME desktop
environment. Its style of window is based on an fps games, and one of
its goals is be easy to reach.

Guake is written mostly in python and has a little piece in C (global
hotkey stuff). The code is placed in the src directory. Files and
images are in the data directory. If you're looking for translation
stuff, you should take a look at the po directory.
