Guake Todo
==========

 - DONE * Code cleanup (Lincoln)

 - DONE * Cleanup image names and maybe create a directory for them
 
 - DONE * Add a feature to set the scrollback history lines in the terminal,
   so add a entry in prefs window to setup it
     
 - DONE * Error handling to can take a default action if something external
   fails. Example:
      When try to load configs from gconf, trying to get a int, but with a
      string in gconf schema, it make a segmentation fault. A error handling
      will come like a piece in a jigsaw :)

 - DONE * Finish Preferences window (Gabriel)

 - DONE * Make translation works (Lincoln)

 * Bug hunting

    - DONE * Guake is appearing on the task list. (Lincoln)

    - DONE * Added a option for this on prefs window: Guake window must hide
      when lose focus. NO! discard it! Some users like to do other things with
      guake opened and above it.

    - Some times, when guake opens, it does not grabs the focus.

    - DONE * When guake is hidden/shown the cursor is appearing on bottom,
    only happens when animate_show/hide is enabled. (Lincoln)

 - DONE * Fix about window (name, site, etc)

 ==== * Release the first alpha version * ====

 - DONE * Pynotify integration

 - DONE * Make that the right click on VTE show a context menu with all options of statusicon menu but show_hide

 * Put a shortcut in gnome menu: System->Preferences-> Guake
 
    - This will show the guake preferences, so user will can configure guake thought without the statusicon shown

 * Threadfy the process of animate show and hide (this was removed for improve
   other things)

 - DONE * Show error when keybind fails - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

 * Add keybindings to:
	# Add new tab OK
